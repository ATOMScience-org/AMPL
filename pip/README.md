# AMPL Pip Build README

There are three requirement files:

1. clients_requirements.txt
2. requirements.txt
3. docker_requirements.txt

`clients_requirements.txt` and `requirements.txt` are used for LLNL LC environment build.
`requirements.txt` is used for the external developers build.
`docker_requirements.txt` is used for AMPL docker image build.
