HEK-293T cells were transfected with the 5HT3a expression construct using Xtreme Gene 9 (Roche) in 150 mm tissue culture treated plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37 ¬∞C. Cells were then split and plated at a density of 60K cells/well in poly-lysine coated, black 96-well plates with clear bottoms (BD BioSciences) and incubated overnight at 37 ¬∞C. Growth media was removed and cells loaded with 200 uL calcium indicator dye in HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES (Calcium 5 Assay kit, Molecular Devices) and incubated at 37 ¬∞C. for 1 hour. While cells were incubating, the 10√ó antagonist and agonist/antagonist addition plates were made. For 10√ó antagonist plate: half log serial dilutions (final concentrations range from 10‚àí7 through 10‚àí10 with the bottom well a negative, no ligand control) were made from test compounds in DMSO at a 1000√ó concentration and then diluted to 10√ó in HBSS/20 mM HEPES. For addition plate: 5HT was diluted to 100√ó in HBSS/20 mM HEPES (final concentration in the assay‚àí216 nM) and 15 uL was added to each well of the addition plate, 15 uL of 10√ó compound was also added to the addition plate, and finally 120 uL of HBSS/20 mM HEPES (for a total of 150 uL). Cells were then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes, then 22.5 uL of 10√ó test compounds were added in triplicate to the plates and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes (Tropisetron was used as a positive control in every assay). Test plate and addition plate were loaded into the FlexStation III (Molecular Devices), and using the fluidics, 22.5 uL compound additions were made (at t=~17 seconds), and fluorescence was measured for 90 seconds, reading every 2.2 seconds.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,Homo sapiens,None,None,HEK-293T,None,,,,CHEMBL1899,Serotonin 3a (5-HT3a) receptor,Homo sapiens,SINGLE PROTEIN,CHEMBL3886642,37,BindingDB Database,,2016,CHEMBL3706569,

HEK-293T cells were transfected with the 5HT3a expression construct using Xtreme Gene 9 (Roche) in 150 mm tissue culture treated plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37 ¬∞C. Cells were then split and plated at a density of 60K cells/well in poly-lysine coated, black 96-well plates with clear bottoms (BD BioSciences) and incubated overnight at 37 ¬∞C. Growth media was removed and cells loaded with 200 uL calcium indicator dye in HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES (Calcium 5 Assay kit, Molecular Devices) and incubated at 37 ¬∞C. for 1 hour. While cells were incubating, the 10√ó antagonist and agonist/antagonist addition plates were made. For 10√ó antagonist plate: half log serial dilutions (final concentrations range from 10‚àí7 through 10‚àí10 with the bottom well a negative, no ligand control) were made from test compounds in DMSO at a 1000√ó concentration and then diluted to 10√ó in HBSS/20 mM HEPES. For addition plate: 5HT was diluted to 100√ó in HBSS/20 mM HEPES (final concentration in the assay‚àí216 nM) and 15 uL was added to each well of the addition plate, 15 uL of 10√ó compound was also added to the addition plate, and finally 120 uL of HBSS/20 mM HEPES (for a total of 150 uL). Cells were then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes, then 22.5 uL of 10√ó test compounds were added in triplicate to the plates and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes (Tropisetron was used as a positive control in every assay).

HEK-293T cells were transfected with the 5-HT3a expression construct using Xtreme Gene 9 (Roche) in 150 mm tissue culture treated plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37¬∞ C. Cells were then split and plated at a density of 60K cells/well in poly-lysine coated, black 96-well plates with clear bottoms (BD BioSciences) and incubated overnight at 37¬∞ C. Growth media was removed and cells loaded with 200 ŒºL calcium indicator dye in HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES (Calcium 5 Assay kit, Molecular Devices) and incubated at 37¬∞ C. for 1 hour. While cells were incubating, the 10√ó antagonist and agonist/antagonist addition plates were made. For 10√ó antagonist plate: half log serial dilutions (final concentrations range from 10^‚àí7 through 10^‚àí10 with the bottom well a negative, no ligand control) were made from test compounds in DMSO at a 1000√ó concentration and then diluted to 10√ó in HBSS/20 mM HEPES. For addition plate: 5HT was diluted to 100√ó in HBSS/20 mM HEPES (final concentration in the assay‚àí216 nM) and 15 ŒºL was added to each well of the addition plate, 15 ŒºL of 10√ó compound was also added to the addition plate, and finally 120 ŒºL of HBSS/20 mM HEPES (for a total of 150 ŒºL). Cells were then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes, then 22.5 ŒºL of 10√ó test compounds were added in triplicate to the plates and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes (Tropisetron was used as a positive control in every assay). Test plate and addition plate were loaded into the FlexStation III (Molecular Devices), and using the fluidics, 22.5 ŒºL compound additions were made (at t=~17 seconds), and fluorescence was measured for 90 seconds, reading every 2.2 seconds.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,Homo sapiens,None,None,HEK-293T,None,,,,CHEMBL1899,Serotonin 3a (5-HT3a) receptor,Homo sapiens,SINGLE PROTEIN,CHEMBL3886747,37,BindingDB Database,,2016,CHEMBL3706569,

HEK-293T cells were transfected with the 5HT3a expression construct using Xtreme Gene 9 (Roche) in 150 mm tissue culture treated plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37 ¬∞C. Cells were then split and plated at a density of 60K cells/well in poly-lysine coated, black 96-well plates with clear bottoms (BD BioSciences) and incubated overnight at 37 ¬∞C. Growth media was removed and cells loaded with 200 uL calcium indicator dye in HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES (Calcium 5 Assay kit, Molecular Devices) and incubated at 37 ¬∞C. for 1 hour. While cells were incubating, the 10√ó antagonist and agonist/antagonist addition plates were made. For 10√ó antagonist plate: half log serial dilutions (final concentrations range from 10‚àí7 through 10‚àí10 with the bottom well a negative, no ligand control) were made from test compounds in DMSO at a 1000√ó concentration and then diluted to 10√ó in HBSS/20 mM HEPES. For addition plate: 5HT was diluted to 100√ó in HBSS/20 mM HEPES (final concentration in the assay‚àí216 nM) and 15 uL was added to each well of the addition plate, 15 uL of 10√ó compound was also added to the addition plate, and finally 120 uL of HBSS/20 mM HEPES (for a total of 150 uL). Cells were then removed from the incubator and equilibrated to room temperature for 10 minutes, then 22.5 uL of 10√ó test compounds were added in triplicate to the plates and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes (Tropisetron was used as a positive control in every assay). Test plate and addition plate were loaded into the FlexStation III (Molecular Devices), and using the fluidics, 22.5 uL compound additions were made (at t=~17 seconds), and fluorescence was measured for 90 seconds, reading every 2.2 seconds.",B,BAO_0000219,cell-based format,Homo sapiens,None,None,HEK-293T,None,,,,CHEMBL1899,Serotonin 3a (5-HT3a) receptor,Homo sapiens,SINGLE PROTEIN,CHEMBL3886642,37,BindingDB Database,,2016,CHEMBL3706569,
