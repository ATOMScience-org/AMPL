# Install AMPL with Docker

Another option to install **[AMPL](https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL)** software is using Docker.  These are the topics to be covered here:

* [Pull or Create a Docker Image](#create-a-docker-image)
   * [Prerequisite: Download and Install Docker](#prerequisite-download-and-install-docker) 
   * [Option 1: Pull a Prebuilt Image From Docker Repo](#option-2-pull-an-existing-ampl-image-from-docker-repo)
   * [Option 2: Build a Local Image Using **Dockerfile**](#option-1-build-a-local-ampl-image-using-dockerfile)
* [Start a Docker Container](#start-a-docker-container)
   * [Use an Existing Image to Start](#use-an-existing-image-to-start-a-container)
* [Launch the Jupyter Notebook Server From a Container](#start-the-jupyter-notebook-from-a-container)
   * [To Open/Create a Jupyter Notebook From a Browser](#to-connect-the-jupyter-notebook-from-a-browser)
   * [Code Examples](#code-examples)
   * [Use **atomsci-env** as the Run Kernel](#use-atomsci-env-as-the-run-kernel-for-AMPL)
   * [Save Work From Docker Jupyter](#save-work-from-docker-jupyter)
* [Useful Docker Commands](#useful-docker-commands)

> **Note:** 
> *If you already have an AMPL image from either option 1 or 2 previously, go to this [Use an existing image to start a container](#use-an-existing-image-to-start-a-container) step to start/run a container.*

# System Requirements
The Docker image will run on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

If you don't have Docker Desktop installed, please follow instructions here: https://www.docker.com/get-started.

Once it's installed, click on the Docker icon to start. Leave it running when using Docker.

# Pull or Create a Docker Image

## Option 1: Pull a Prebuilt AMPL Image from Docker Repo

The simplest method is to download a prebuilt Docker image from DockerHub. For every official AMPL release, a docker image will be pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/atomsci/atomsci-ampl). 

To pull a prebuilt AMPL image:

```
docker pull atomsci/atomsci-ampl:latest
```

After that, follow the instruction from [Start a Docker Container](#start-a-docker-container) step.

## Option 2: Build a Local Image Using **Dockerfile**



There may be a few reasons why you want to build your own AMPL Image using a Dockerfile.  These can include:

    * You want to customize the install options for your environment,
    * You want to test a development version/branch to try new features or bugfixes

First, clone **[AMPL](https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL)**  github repo. 

```
git clone https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL.git  
### The following line is _optional_. If you want to check out a development branch instead of the default branch (master).
git checkout 1.6.1                    # (optional) checkout a dev branch, 1.6.1 for example
cd AMPL/docker                        # Dockerfile is in AMPL/docker directory
```

To build a Docker image:

```
# example 1
docker build -t atomsci-ampl .       # by default, "latest" will be the tag

# - or - 
# example 2
docker build -t atomsci-ampl:<tag> . # specify a name for <tag>
```

This normally takes about 15-20 minutes to build. The image can be reused.

> **Note:** *To build without cache, add "--no-cache" flag after "docker build". For example, "docker build --no-cache -t atomsci-ampl ."*

Once it's built, follow the **[Start a Docker container](#start-a-container-from-the-ampl-image)** step to run the **[AMPL](https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL)** docker container.

# Start a Docker Container

## Use an Existing Image to Start

If you have an image built/downloaded, type "docker images" to see what images are currently available. 
Pick the one that you want to use. Type the "docker run" command ro run. For example:

![Docker Run](../../docs/source/_static/img/01_install_from_docker_files/docker_run.png)

The "docker run" command syntax:

```
docker run -it -p <port>:<port> -v <local_folder>:<directory_in_docker> <IMAGE>
```

Examples
```
# example 1 # if built from a Dockerfile
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/home atomsci-ampl

# - or -
# example 2 # if pulled from atomsci
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/home atomsci/atomsci-ampl
```

To get more info for the "docker run" command options, type "docker run --help". For example: 
 
```
  -i, --interactive                    Keep STDIN open even if not attached
  -t, --tty                            Create a pseudo terminal
  -p, --publish port(s) list           Publish a container's port(s) to the host
  -v, --volume list                    Bind mount a volume </pre>
```

## Launch the Jupyter Notebook Server From a Container

To launch Jupyter Notebook Server from a container, you can choose to run from a "jupyter-notebook" or "jupyter-lab" assigning the port you opened. The examples provided here are from "jupyter-notebook":

Inside the docker container
```
jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --port=8888 &
```
This will output a message with similar URLs to this:

![Jupyter Notebook Token](../../docs/source/_static/img/01_install_from_docker_files/jupyter_token.png)


### To Create/Open the Jupyter Notebook From a Browser

Copy and paste the URL from the output message (highlighted in yellow from the above screenshot) to the browser on your computer. For example:

![Notebook URL](../../docs/source/_static/img/01_install_from_docker_files/browser_url.png)



> **NOTE:**
> *If this doesn't work, exit the container and choose a different port
> such as "7777" or "8899" (in all 3 places it's 
> written), then rerun both commands in 
> [Start a Docker container](#start-a-container-from-the-ampl-image) and 
> [Start the Jupyter notebook from a container](#start-the-Jupyter-notebook-from-a-container). 
> Be sure to save any work in your container. This is because if the container 
> is shut down, you'll lose anything not in that folder. See instructions on [Save work from Docker Jupyter](#save-work-from-docker-jupyter).*  

Once connected, you will see a screen like this:

![Notebook Screen](../docs/source/_static/img/01_install_from_docker_files/docker_container_nb.png)

### Code Examples

The **[AMPL](https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL)** code is in:

```
http://127.0.0.1:<port_number>/tree/AMPL/atomsci/ddm/
```

The tutorials examples are in:
```
http://127.0.0.1:<port_number>/tree/AMPL/atomsci/ddm/examples/tutorials
```

> **Note:** *"<port_number>" is the number that you used when starting "docker run -p ...".*

An example screenshot of the tutorials directory:

![directory_tree](../../docs/source/_static/img/01_install_from_docker_files/tutorial_tree.png)

Also, there are examples in 
**[AMPL's Read the Docs](https://ampl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** on how to use the **[AMPL](https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL)** Framework.

### Use **atomsci-env** as the Run Kernel

* To use AMPL Framework, please select "atomsci-env" as the run kernel - from a notebook, top menu bar "Kernel" > "Change Kernel" > "atomsci-env"

![Select a kernel from a notebook](../../docs/source/_static/img/01_install_from_docker_files/docker-kernel-inside-nb.png)

### Save Work From Docker Jupyter

A Docker container is stateless. Once you exit, the work will not persist. There are a couple of ways to save your files:

1) From the browser Jupyter Notebook page menu - "File" -> "Download" to download the file(s).

2) Use mount. When you start the Docker with "-v" option:

```
docker run -it -p <port>:<port> -v <local_folder>:<directory_in_docker> <IMAGE>
```

It binds the <local_folder> with <directory_in_docker>, meaning that the file(s) in <directory_in_docker>, will be available in <local_folder>.

For example:

* Run the docker with "-v" to bind the directories

```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ~:/home atomsci-ampl # <local_folder> -> "~", <directory_in_docker> -> "/home".
```

* Save, copy the file(s) to <directory_in_docker>

```
root@d8ae116b2a83:/AMPL# pwd
/AMPL
root@d8ae116b2a83:/AMPL# cp atomsci/ddm/examples/01_install_from_docker.md /home
```

* The file(s) will be in <local_folder>

### Useful Docker Commands

```
docker run --help                              # get help messages
docker ps -a                                   # check docker processes
docker images                                  # list local docker images
docker rmi <image>                             # remove an image
docker cp file.txt <container_id>:/file.txt    # copy from local to container
docker cp <container_id>:source_path dest_path # copy from container to local
