"""Code to split a DeepChem dataset by assigning compounds produced before a cutoff date to the training and validation subsets,
and compounds from after the cutoff date to the test subset. This is typically used to assess training performance
under a simulated drug discovery scenario, in which models are trained on early lead compounds and used to predict properties
of compounds designed later.

Requires that the date associated with each compound be specified when constructing the splitter.

Although this class and its methods are public, you will typically not call them directly. Instead, they are invoked by
setting `splitter` to 'temporal' and setting appropriate values for the `cutoff_date`, `date_col` and `base_splitter`
parameters when you train a model.
