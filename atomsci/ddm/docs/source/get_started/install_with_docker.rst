Install AMPL With Docker
########################

This page provides an option to use Docker to install `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_. For an alternate way, please see the "Getting Started" `Install <https://ampl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/install.html>`_ page.

To install `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ software using Docker, the major steps are:

* :ref:`Create Docker`
* :ref:`Start container`
* :ref:`Start Jupyter notebook`

.. _Create Docker:

Create or Pull a Docker Image
*****************************

System Requirements
===================

The Docker image will run on Linux / WSL / macOS.

If you don't have Docker Desktop installed, please follow instructions `here <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_.

Once it's installed, click on the Docker icon to start. Leave it running when using Docker.

You can either pull a prebuilt `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ image (option 1) or build one yourself (option 2).

Option 1: Pull a Prebuilt AMPL Image from Docker Repo
=====================================================

The simplest method is to download a prebuilt Docker image from DockerHub. For every official `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ release, a docker image will be pushed to its `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/atomsci/atomsci-ampl>`_. 

To pull a prebuilt `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ image, the method varies based on its version.

For a pre-1.6.3 release:

.. code-block::

   docker pull atomsci/atomsci-ampl:v1.6.2   # Specify a version to pull, ie, v1.6.2.

For 1.6.3 and later, you can download the latest images for various platforms (CPU, GPU, or Linux/ARM64), an example: 

.. code-block::

   docker pull atomsci/atomsci-ampl:latest-cpu   # Specify the latest image built for a platform (use those for tags 'cpu', 'gpu', or 'arm') 

After that, please follow the instruction from the ":ref:`Start container`" step.

Option 2: Build an Image Using **Dockerfile**
=============================================

There may be a few reasons why you want to build your own `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ Image using a Dockerfile.  These can include:


* You want to customize the install options for your environment,
* You want to test a development version/branch to try new features or bugfixes

First clone `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_  github repo, then find the Dockerfile:

.. code-block::

   git clone https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL.git  
   ### The following line is _optional_. If you want to check out a development branch instead of the default branch (master).
   git checkout 1.6.3                    # (optional) checkout a dev branch, 1.6.3 for example
   cd AMPL

Starting from version 1.6.3, a 'Makefile' is available that offers various options for building, running, saving, and loading Docker images. Please refer to this `doc <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL/Makefile.md>`_ for more infomation. Here is an example to build a local image:

.. code-block::

   make build-docker           # The default platform is CPU. Use 'PLATFORM=gpu' for GPU or 'ARCH=linux/arm64' for ARM chip platform

This normally takes about 15-20 minutes to build. Once it's built on your machine, it can be reused.

.. note::

    *To build without cache, add "--no-cache" flag after "docker build". *

.. _Start container:

Run a Docker Container
**********************

To see what images are running on your machine, type "docker images". 


.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/docker_run.png

Use "docker run ... `<IMAGE>`" command to start the container. The command syntax is:

.. code-block::

   docker run -it -p <port>:<port> -v <local_folder>:<directory_in_docker> <IMAGE> bash

Use the following example to start the container. For images created or downloaded from version 1.6.3 or later, append 'bash' to the end of the docker run command to open a bash session. By default, the container starts with a Python interpreter session. 

.. code-block::

    docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ${PWD}:/home atomsci/atomsci-ampl:latest:cpu bash   # replace with your <IMAGE>:<TAG>

To get more info for the "docker run" command options, type "docker run --help": 

.. code-block::

     -i, --interactive                    Keep STDIN open even if not attached
     -t, --tty                            Create a pseudo terminal
     -p, --publish port(s) list           Publish a container's port(s) to the host
     -v, --volume list                    Bind mount a volume

.. _Start Jupyter notebook:

Start the Notebook Server From a Container
*******************************************

To launch the server, you can choose to run using "jupyter-notebook" or "jupyter-lab" using the same port when starting the container. We use "jupyter-notebook" command as examples here:

.. code-block::

   jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --port=8888 &

This will output a message with similar URLs to this:


.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/jupyter_token.png

Connect to the Jupyter Notebook UI From a Browser
=================================================

Copy and paste the URL from the output message (highlighted in yellow from above) to the browser on your computer. Like this one:


.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/browser_url.png

.. note::

    *If this doesn't work, exit the container and choose a different port
    such as "7777" or "8899" (in all 3 places it's 
    written), then rerun both commands in "Start a Docker container" and 
    "Start the Jupyter notebook from a container". 
    Be sure to save any work in your container. See instructions on how to "Save work from Docker Jupyter".*  

Once connected, you will see a screen like this:


.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/docker_container_nb.png


Code Examples
=============

The `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ code is in:

.. code-block::

   http://127.0.0.1:<port_number>/tree/AMPL/atomsci/ddm/

The tutorials examples are in:

.. code-block::

   http://127.0.0.1:<port_number>/tree/AMPL/atomsci/ddm/examples/tutorials

.. note::

    *"<port_number>" is the number that you used when starting "docker run -p ...".*


Here's a screenshot of the `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ tutorials directory:


.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/tutorial_tree.png


Use **atomsci-env** as the Run Kernel
=====================================

**This section is required only for images created from version 1.6.2 or earlier.**

In order to use `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ Framework, select "atomsci-env" as the run kernel for the notebook. This should be set during image creation. In case it's not set, or if you want to verify. Try one of the following:

From an existing notebook, top menu bar "Kernel" > "Change Kernel" > "atomsci-env"

.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/docker-kernel-inside-nb.png


From a new notebook, click "File" > "New" > "Notebook" menu, and select **atomsci-env** as the run kernel

.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/docker-kernel-outside-nb.png

Save Work From Docker
=====================

A Docker container is stateless. Once you exit, the work will not persist. There are a couple of ways to save your files:

1) From the browser Jupyter Notebook page menu, "File" -> "Download" to download the file(s).

2) Use mount. When you start the Docker with "-v" option:

.. code-block::

   docker run -it -p <port>:<port> -v <local_folder>:<directory_in_docker> <IMAGE>

It binds the <local_folder> with <directory_in_docker> , meaning that the file(s) in <directory_in_docker>, will be available in <local_folder>.

For example:


Run the docker with "-v" to bind the directories

.. code-block::

   docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v ~:/home atomsci-ampl # <local_folder> -> "~", <directory_in_docker> -> "/home".


Save, copy the file(s) to <directory_in_docker>

.. code-block::

   root@d8ae116b2a83:/AMPL# pwd
   /AMPL
   root@d8ae116b2a83:/AMPL# cp atomsci/ddm/examples/02_perform_a_split.ipynb /home


The file(s) will be in the <local_folder>.


Useful Docker Commands
======================

.. code-block::

   docker run --help                              # get help messages
   docker ps -a                                   # check docker processes
   docker images                                  # list local docker images
   docker rmi <image>                             # remove an image
   docker cp file.txt <container_id>:/file.txt    # copy from local to container
   docker cp <container_id>:source_path dest_path # copy from container to local

Troubleshooting
===============

Problem with token

If you try to connect the Jupyter Notebook URL, but got a prompt for password or token, go to the docker terminal, type in

.. code-block::

   jupyter server list

.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/jupyter_server_list.png

And copy the string after "token=" and  paste that, then click "Log in"

.. image:: ../_static/img/install_with_docker_files/localhost_token.png
