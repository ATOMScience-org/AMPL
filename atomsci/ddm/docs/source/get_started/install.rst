Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------
**AMPL** is a Python 3 package that has been developed and run in a specific pip environment.
 
Basic Install
-------------
Clone the git repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
::

    git clone https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL.git
 
Please refer to this link, https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL#Install, for details.

Create pip environment::

    module load python/3.9.12 # use python 3.9.12
    python3 -m venv atomsci # create a new pip env
    source atomsci/bin/activate # activate the environemt

    python3 -m pip install pip --upgrade
    cd $AMPL_HOME/pip # cd to AMPL repo's pip directory

    pip3 install --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt

.. note::

   Depending on system performance, creating the environment can take some time.

Build and Install AMPL
----------------------
Go to the AMPL root directory and install the AMPL package::

    source atomsci/bin/activate # activate the environemt
    cd ..
    ./build.sh
    pip3 install -e .

* The `install.sh` system command installs AMPL directly in the pip environment. If `install.sh` alone is used, then AMPL is installed in the `$HOME/.local` directory.

* After this process, you will have an `atomsci` pip environment with all dependencies installed. The name of the AMPL package is `atomsci-ampl` and is installed in the `install.sh` script to the environment with pip.  

Install with Docker
-------------------
* Download and install Docker Desktop.
   * `Docker Getting Started <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_
* Create a workspace folder to mount with Docker environment and transfer files.
* Get the Docker image and run it::

    docker pull atomsci/atomsci-ampl
    docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v </local_workspace_folder>:</directory_in_docker> atomsci/atomsci-ampl
    #inside docker environment
    jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --port=8888 &
    # -OR-
    jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root --port=8888 &

* Visit the provided URL in your browser, ie
   * http://d33b0faf6bc9:8888/?token=656b8597498b18db2213b1ec9a00e9d738dfe112bbe7566d
   * Replace the d33b0faf6bc9 with localhost
   * If this doesn't work, exit the container and change port from 8888 to some other number such as 7777 or 8899 (in all 3 places it's written), then rerun both commands

* Be sure to save any work you want to be permanent in your workspace folder. If the container is shut down, you'll lose anything not in that folder.
