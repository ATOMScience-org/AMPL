------------

Welcome to the `ATOM Modeling PipeLine (AMPL) <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ tutorial series. Our tutorial series is set-up for our user's (usersâ€™?) to take a hands-on approach to employing  `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ in a step-by-step guide. We will start from the basics, assuming that you are new to either coding or **machine learning**, to build a foundational framework to use `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_  that you can then use to do meaningful work.

Goal
****

Our goal is for the user (users?) to employ the core tutorials that represents the end-to-end modeling pipeline to build a **machine learning** model and then the ability to screen a virtual library. 
 
We have created easy to follow set of tutorials to walk an intermediate **Python** user through the steps necessary to install `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_, curate a dataset, effectively train and evaluate a **machine learning** model, and use that model to make predictions.
