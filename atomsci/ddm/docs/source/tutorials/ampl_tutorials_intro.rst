------------

Welcome to the `ATOM Modeling PipeLine (AMPL) <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ tutorial series. Our tutorial series is set up for 
our user community to take a hands-on approach to employing `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_ in a step-by-step guide. We will start 
from the basics, with the assumption you are an intermediate Python user or new to machine learning, to use `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_  
to build a foundational framework that you can then use to do meaningful work.

****
Goal
****

Our goal is for the user community to employ the core nine tutorials that represents the end-to-end modeling pipeline to build **QSAR** machine learning models and then be able to screen a virtual library to predict the property of your choice. 
 
We have created easy to follow tutorials to walk through the steps necessary to install `AMPL <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL>`_, curate a dataset, effectively train and evaluate a machine learning model, and use that model to make predictions.


************************************** 
End-to-End Modeling Pipeline Tutorials
**************************************

* Tutorial 1: Install AMPL From Docker   # An option to set up a run environment.
* Tutorial 2: Data Curation
* Tutorial 3: Splitting Datasets for Validation and Testing
* Tutorial 4: Train a Simple Regression Model
* Tutorial 5: Application of a Trained Model
* Tutorial 6: Hyperparamter Optimization 
* Tutorial 7: Comparing Models to Select the Best Hyperparameters
* Tutorial 8: Train a Production Model
* Tutorial 9: Visualizations of Model Performance

.. note:: 
   
    *Throughout the tutorials, we employ an example dataset (small molecule inhibition of the dopamine transporter SLC6A3) with the intent for our users to follow 
    the step-by-step guide with each tutorial. While the tutorials are meant to be followed in order, the necessary files to run each one 
    independently are included in the AMPL GitHub repo. If a user wants to recreate our results, please be aware that dependencies are created 
    as you progress through each tutorial.*
