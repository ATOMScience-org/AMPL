Running AMPL
============

**AMPL** can be run from the command line or by importing into `Python` scripts and `Jupyter notebooks`.
 

Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks
------------------------------------
**AMPL** can be used to fit and predict molecular activities and properties by importing the appropriate modules. See the examples for more descriptions on how to fit and make predictions using **AMPL**.
 


Pipeline parameters (options)
-----------------------------
**AMPL** includes many parameters to run various model fitting and prediction tasks.

* Pipeline options (parameters) can be set within JSON files containing a parameter list.
* The parameter list with detailed explanations of each option can be found at `atom/ddm/docs/PARAMETERS.md <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL/blob/master/atomsci/ddm/docs/PARAMETERS.md>`_. 
* Example pipeline JSON files can be found in the tests directory and the example directory.
 

Library documentation
---------------------
**AMPL** includes detailed docstrings and comments to explain the modules. Full HTML documentation of the Python library is available with the package at `atomsci/ddm/docs/build/html/index.html. <https://github.com/ATOMScience-org/AMPL/blob/master/atomsci/ddm/docs/build/html/index.html>`_.
